# Popular-Vote-Minimizer

The President of the United States is not elected by a popular vote, but by a majority vote in the Electoral College. Each of the 50 states, plus DC, gets some number of electors in the Electoral College, and whoever they vote in becomes the next President. There are four occurrences where the winner of the Electoral College and eventual President Elect did not win the popular vote (plus the 1824 election where the House of Representatives decided the winner). For the purposes of this project, we're going to make some simplifying assumptions:

You need to win a majority of the votes in a state to earn its electors, and you get all the state's electors if you win the majority of the votes. For example, in a small state with 999,999 people, you'd need 500,000 votes to win all its electors. These assumptions aren’t entirely accurate, both because in most states a plurality suffices and some states split their electoral votes in other ways.
You need to win a majority of the electoral votes to become president. In the 2008 election, you'd need 270 votes because there were 538 electors. In the 1804 election, you'd need 89 votes because there were only 176 electors. (You can technically win the presidency without winning the Electoral College; we'll ignore this for simplicity.)
Electors never defect. The electors in the Electoral College are free to vote for whomever they please, but the expectation is that they'll vote for the candidate that won their home state. As a simplifying assumption, we'll just pretend electors always vote with the majority of their state.
This project explores the following central question: under the assumptions laid out above, for past elections ...

What was the fewest number of popular votes you could get and still be elected President of the United States of America?
In order to answer this central question, the programming tasks involve command-line arguments, writing a useful makefile, file input, writing a recursive function, developing your own test cases, optimizing recursion using memoization, and file output.
